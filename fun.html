        amazing graphic tees, designer tees, and geek tees that are made for
        engineers. Engineers are pretty much everywhere doing everything from

    <p>What do mechanical engineers do?</p>
    <p>
      Mechanical engineers design power-producing machines, such as electric
      generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines, as
      well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning
      systems. Mechanical engineers design other machines inside buildings, such
      as elevators and escalators.

        >James Watt is often coined the father of mechanical engineering because
        it was that particular invention that gave way to many more important
        developments of the industrial revolution and beyond. His invention was
        also central in the development of the profession of mechanical
        engineering.</em
